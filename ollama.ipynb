The code below reads the CSV file, searches for matches to the user question, and then generates a response based on the information found. Note that this will take longer than any of the previous examples, as it sends more data to the model. If you notice the answer is still not grounded in the data, you can try system engineering or try other models. Generally, RAG is more effective with either larger models or with fine-tuned versions of SLMs."
